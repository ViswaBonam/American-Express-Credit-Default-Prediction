## Understanding the data

In the world of financial analytics, As a team of data scientists our goal was to work towards to building a credit default prediction model for American Express. Our goal was clear – reduce credit risk and identify high risk borrowers before they defaulted on their loans. One of the critical decisions we faced was to choose the right dataset for model development. As for our dataset we had chosen data with April 2018 originations for several reasons.
- Historical context and risk mitigation:- The financial industry is highly dynamic and April 2018 marked an interesting point of time, just before potential economic shifts. Using this data helped us to capture nuances of borrower's behavior during this transitional period. The financial had identified an increase in credit default cases in the months following April 2018, by focusing on this timeframe we aimed to build a model that could effectively predict defaults.
- Data availability and recent data :- The April 2018 origination data was readily available and well structured, making it easier for data preparation helping us to reduce time and effort. The data was also recent but not too recent, reflecting the financial landscape and borrower behavior, However it also had historical context allowing model to capture patterns and trends and helping us to build a robust and reliable model.

In the end, we were able to build a highly effective credit default prediction model that was able to identify high risk borrowers early in their credit journey. The strategy employed in training and testing the data based on 2018 April origins helped us build a reliable model that can help financial institutions reduce defaults and optimize lending practices and adapt to a changing financial landscape thus helping them achieve better financial and risk management.
